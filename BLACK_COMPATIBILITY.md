# Black Compatibility Issue Resolution

## Issue
Black is currently disabled due to a compatibility issue with Click 8.2.2 and Python 3.13.

## Error Message
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'echo' from 'click'
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Downgrade Click (Recommended)
```bash
pip install 'click<8.2.0'
```

### Option 2: Use a Different Python Version
If possible, use Python 3.11 or 3.12 instead of 3.13.

### Option 3: Wait for Black Update
This is a known issue that will be fixed in future Black releases.

## Current Status
- ✅ autoflake (unused import removal) - Working
- ✅ isort (import sorting) - Working
- ❌ Black (code formatting) - Temporarily disabled

## Manual Black Usage
Once the compatibility issue is resolved, you can:

1. Re-enable Black in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` by uncommenting the Black section
2. Run `pre-commit install` to reinstall hooks
3. Use `black .` to format code manually

## Alternative Formatting
For now, the project uses:
- `autoflake` for removing unused imports
- `isort` for sorting imports
- Manual formatting following PEP 8 guidelines

## Commands Available
```bash
# Remove unused imports only
make clean-imports

# Format imports and remove unused ones
make format

# Check formatting
make check-format
```
